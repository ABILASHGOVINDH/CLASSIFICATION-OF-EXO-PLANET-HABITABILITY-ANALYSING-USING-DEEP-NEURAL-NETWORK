# 🌍 Exoplanet Habitability Analysis 🚀

Welcome to the **Exoplanet Habitability Analysis** project! 🪐 This project evaluates the potential habitability of exoplanets based on various parameters like mass, radius, distance from the star, and more. 🌟

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is divided into three modules:
1. **exoplanet_data.py** 📊 - Reads and processes exoplanet data.
2. **habitability_analysis.py** 🔬 - Analyzes the habitability based on key metrics.
3. **main.py** 🏁 - Runs the entire pipeline to determine the habitability of exoplanets.

## 🏗️ Features
✅ Reads and processes exoplanet data from CSV files.
✅ Filters exoplanets based on size, temperature, and other factors.
✅ Calculates a habitability score.
✅ Outputs the most promising exoplanets for further research. 🔍
